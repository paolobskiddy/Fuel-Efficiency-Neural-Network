# Fuel Efficiency Regressor
## Description

This neural network model was designed to predict the **combination_mpg** of a car given its model, year, amongst other attributes.
(I did look up how combination_mpg is calculated, which is (0.55* City_mpg)+(0.45* highway_mpg))

Originally made and to be published under kaggle, I decided to move the files here instead.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:
- **Fuel_efficiency.ipynb**:

  The notebook used to preprocess the training data, train the neural network, and evaluate its performance
- **car_data.csv**:

  The dataset sourced from kaggle.

## Data Source
