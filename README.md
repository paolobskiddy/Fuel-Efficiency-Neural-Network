# Fuel Efficiency Regressor
## Description

This neural network model was designed to predict the **combination_mpg** of a car given its model, year, amongst other attributes.
(I did look up how combination_mpg is calculated, which is (0.55* City_mpg)+(0.45* highway_mpg))

Originally made and to be published under kaggle, I decided to move the files here instead.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:
- **Fuel_efficiency.ipynb**:

  The notebook used to preprocess the training data, train the neural network, and evaluate its performance
- **car_data.csv**:

  The dataset sourced from kaggle.
- **Notebooks**

  Contains the notebooks used to preprocess the data, construct the neural network, and evaluation.
  - Data_Preprocessing contains the preprocessing procedure on the dataset
  - Model_Training contains the neural network construction and its training, as well as some visualization on the model's performance during training.
  - Model_Evaluation contains the neural network's performance on unseen data.
- **img**

  used for storing the images shown here.
- **tools**

  contains the dumped pkl file of the vectorizer used for data preprocessing. I used TfIdf Vectorizer for this case.
